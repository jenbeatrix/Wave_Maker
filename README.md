# Wave_Maker_Version_1
The Wave maker basically generates the waves in the wave tank using a motor equipped with a gearbox. An L298N Motor Driver Module is used to control the speed of the motor. The mechanism applied for the wave maker is a plunger mechanism. This mechanism vertically moves, up and down to generate the waves in the wave tank. This version of the wave maker is controlled by typing a specific number on the serial, thus the speed of the motor will depend on the choice of the user. The mechanism duration will be 30 seconds.

For PWM minimum and maximum values are from 0 to 255
