# Wave_Maker_Version_1
The Wave maker basically generates the waves in the wave tank using a motor equipped with a gearbox. An L298N Motor Driver Module is used to control the speed of the motor. The mechanism applied for the wave maker is a plunger mechanism. This mechanism vertically moves, up and down to generate the waves in the wave tank. This version of the wave maker is a Serial Controlled Motor driver thus the speed of the motor will depend on the choice of the user. The mechanism duration will be 30 seconds.
