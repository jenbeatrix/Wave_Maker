# Wave_Maker_Version_1
The Wave maker basically generates the waves in the wave tank using a motor. An L298N Motor Driver Module is used to control the speed of the motor. The mechanism applied for the wave maker is a plunger mechanism. This mechanism vertically moves, up and down to generate the waves in the wave tank. This version of the wave maker is controlled by typing a specific number on the serial monitor, thus the speed of the motor will depend on the choice of the user. The mechanism duration is about 30 seconds.

For PWM minimum and maximum values are from 0 to 255

Choose speed for the motor

1 = 130 rpm

2 = 150 rpm

3 = 180 rpm

4 = 210 rpm

5 = 240 rpm

6 = 255 rpm

Based on the results, the motor will only move with an RPM of 180-255.
